NAME

uc

DESCRIPTION

A program to convert all the characters in a string to upper case. It operates
on the command line arguments or stdin if no arguments are provided. If reading
from stdin, it loops, waiting for input until EOF (ctrl-d).

The program has been written in several languages. A test suite is included
that automates testing an implementation against a predefined set of input.

BUILDING

make [language] where language is one of c, python, or haskell.

USAGE

./uc [string] [...]

EXAMPLES

./uc hello world
HELLO WORLD

./uc
hello world
HELLO WORLD
