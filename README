DESCRIPTION

A collection of simple programs written to learn various languages and their
strengths and weaknesses. Each program is implemented in several languages
against a well defined specification. A test harness is used against each
implementation to ensure it complies with the spec.

Each exercise is in a separate directory with its own README.
